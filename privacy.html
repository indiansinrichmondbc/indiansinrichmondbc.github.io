  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: February 28, 2026</p>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how personal information is collected, used, and protected when you use the Indians in Richmond, BC website ("the Site").
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do not actively collect personal information about visitors. If you choose to contact us, join our WhatsApp group, or participate in our social media groups, your information may be subject to those platforms' privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services & Facebook</h2>
  <p>
    Our site links to external sites and uses third-party services, including StatCounter for analytics and social media platforms such as Facebook. Your activity on Facebook, including joining our group or interacting with Facebook content, is governed by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy" target="_blank">Facebook's Privacy Policy</a> and not this site. We do not control external providers and encourage you to review their privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>
    Any information you choose to share with us (for example, by submitting a business listing) is used solely for community purposes and will not be sold or rented to third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    The Site itself does not set first-party cookies. Third-party services (such as analytics providers or social platforms) may set cookies according to their own policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable steps to protect your information, but no method of transmission over the internet is completely secure. Please use discretion when sharing personal information.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be posted on this page with a revised date.
